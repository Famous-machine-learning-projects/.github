In this organization, I intend to share some of the most interesting issues in machine learning.


Supervised learning: Models that can predict labels based on labeled training data

- Classification: Models that predict labels as two or more discrete categories
- Regression: Models that predict continuous labels

Unsupervised learning: Models that identify structure in unlabeled data

- Clustering: Models that detect and identify distinct groups in the data
- Dimensionality reduction: Models that detect and identify lower-dimensional structure in higher-dimensional data

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
